      <h1 class="js-show-text">About Myself</h1>
      <p class="about__text">
        Hello, my name is Mio Ebisu. I was born and raised in Japan, Tokyo. I moved to Berlin in 2015 and moved to
        London in 2018. <br>
        I live in East London and live on a narrowboat with my family. My partner, 1 year + 4 months daughter
        and one female black cat.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="about__text">
        My background is Fine Art, contemporary painting. I studied BA at Musashino Art University
        in Japan and MA at University of the Arts London. I have had many solo exhibitions, group shows, artist
        residencies. Since 2012, I have been represented by a commercial gallery in Tokyo. As well as making paintings,
        I had a research project that was granted by Arts
        Council England. My theme was making my own paints using raw materials. I could make paints from stone and
        plants! I usually use oil paints and acrylic paints as well as making my own. I love painting, thinking and
        making stuff.</p>


      <h1 class="js-show-text">Why Web developer? </h1>
      <p class="about__text">I may sound like a wrong person to be interested in Software Engineering??? I used to
        have a complex feeling with
        technology. I was
        not good at using Adobe Illustrator like my friends from art university. I am not the neatest person as I love
        to
        be in the messy art studio.
        Also, I blame the society, the technology industry was very male dominant so
        I believed I may be not be good at because I am women! But It did not mean, I did not like it. I just did not
        think I can do it.

      <p class="about__text">
        Even though I achieved to have regular exhibitions in the super competitive fine art industry, money is always a
        problem. I needed to have another job to cover pay my bill. I have completely different CV one is for job, one
        for art. Job CV always looks inconsistent and it does not represent my experience, missing the biggest part but
        my experience in art is very hard to be recognized to other industry. I wanted to have other technical skills I
        can develop and more recognizable in job market. So, I decided to go to IT industry.

      </p>

      <p class="about__text">
        So, for this my long journey, I tried to get tech related job. Fortunately, I started working as LQA, game
        localization tester in 2022. This is full remote
        job, work
        from home, PC and mobile, wifi router, lots of cables, etc. I realized I am very interested in how system
        underneath works each other through this job. The fun part of the job, find bugs lots of trouble shooting on
        software, and hardware. We use chat only to
        communicate to tackle the problem, share the knowledge tips. I loved to think why and how those bugs are
        occured. To think wide and micro, I am fascinated by those industry.I gained my confidence in technology and
        problem-solving thinking. And I want to understand the software side bit more to understand what
        happening underneath.Also, all my collegues are such a fantastic
        people, smart, fun, and hard working. I want to work with people like them.
      </p>



      <p class="about__text">
        Also, I know many musician friends
        who are software engenierrs. I am inspired from them as well. They are in my community, but also work as super
        technical skill job. I thought because of the opensource culture is very big in software development, the
        passion people have is not only for money or employment, purely technology and simply love making, and puzzle
        solving. I like the passion. I found it similar to art that I am attracted to. Once I start learning, I love
        them. It is like total another universe exists. very different from human world. But whole universe and order in
        here. then the possiblities of making is just unlimited. I love making, so of course I want to become a
        developer to make and find bugs, be in the community also many job opportunities! The below is my paintings.
        Here is my website.

        <li class="learning__description">This is my first ever step into learning code. I did not know anything about
          this field.
          I chosen Python because when I search online which language is good for a beginner? Many source say Python is
          the good to start. So I searched government funded Python course. It was fully online, the course was more
          focus on theory and exam taking, so I took three exams Azure Fundamentals, Python, and Azure intermeditate.
          Even though myself love exam(I literally love it) it was hard to pass! I pass the Fundamentals and missed 3
          scores to pass the Python and nearly! the third one. So I learnt the
          basic concept of Cloud and Azure but I felt I can not make anything!.</li>

        <li class="learning__description">After I was exposed to the Cloud and Python I liked it. So I decided to carry
          on the path. I really wanted to make something from scratch. I found this workshop through reading a female
          software developer she talked
          about her career change path from creative background to become a web developer. It looks very friendly and
          nice community.
          I was 32th weeks of pregnant
          and travelled to Cardiff to participate in this workshop. It was run as a part of the programm within Pycon. I
          was scared of being surrounded by tech expert but the Pycon atmosphere was super inclusive, welcome,
          community-minded, fun and just super nice to be there. Django girls team was just excellent super warm, kind
          and lots of passion. I did not have enough knowledge of HTML and CSS so it was bit of struggle but the blog I
          made was brilliant. I am using the blog as my daughter's development diary still. Very precious.</li>

        <li class="learning__description">My daughter was born Novermber. So I really did not have any time to learn for
          few months(did not have time to sleep or eat!). But after few months of off from work and learning, I felt my
          brain is going somewhere. I don't want to forget the coding. So I started doing this course. I thought because
          I am working in testing and using Python it would be useful for upskiliing. Then, I realized, it is fun to
          learn and make code for file transfer, make the files small. I still can not make anything.</li>

        <li class="learning__description">I was looking for a job as Software QA tester to enter the tech world. This
          role requirements are mostly, experience of testing API(Postman), SQL. I feel I know the brief scope or
          concept of web. (I don't like to leave the concept or context if I don't really get it. I am easily
          distracted.) So I am ready to make something now so I decided to learn HTML and CSS. I made the website before
          but I searched, wrote, somehow worked. So I did not know what I was doing. I applied a job QA software tester
          at software company. I was invited to have an interview. I have never been so excited to think of working at
          the software company. Equally excited as art that I have never before. For my, outside of the world is always
          I am awkward one. but I need to have another job to pay the bill. So this skill is very employable and skill
          with my hand just a dream. It becomes my dream now. The interview was fun even. Unfortunatelly, I was not
          chosen but as long as I keep making and learning I will be able to work in this industry. </li>
