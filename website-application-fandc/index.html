    <!-- About myself and why I want to become a web developer -->
    <section class="about">
      <p class="about__text">I moved to London in 2018 from Berlin, before Berlin I was born and grown up in Tokyo
        Japan. Since 2018, I have been living on a narrowboat with my family, my partner, my 1 year + 4months daughter
        and one black cat. My background is Fine Art, contemporary painting. I studied BA at Musashino Art University in
        Japan and MA at University of the Arts London. Since 2012, I have been represented by a commercial gallery in
        Tokyo and I have had many solo exhibitions, group shows, artist residencies, research project granted by Arts
        Council England. My research theme was making my own paints using raw materials. I am a classic introvert, love
        painting, thinking and making stuff.

      <p class="about__text">I may sound like a wrong person to be here???Yes, I used to have a complex feeling with
        technology. I was
        not good at using Adobe Illustrator like my
        friends, I was not the neat person. And I blame the society, the technology industry seems very male dominant so
        I believed I may be not good at because I am women!
        The things has changed since I started working as LQA, game localization tester. This is full remote job, work
        from home, the job is very fun, lots of trouble shooting on software, and hardware. We use chat only to
        communicate to tackle the problem, share the knowledge tips. I loved to think why and how those bugs are
        occured. To think wide and micro, I am fascinated by those industry.I gained my confidence in technology and
        problem-solving thinking. And I want to understand the software side bit more to understand what
        happening underneath.Also, all my collegues are such a fantastic
        people, smart, fun, and hard working. I want to work with people like them. Also, I know many musician friends
        who are software engenierrs. I am inspired from them as well. They are in my community, but also work as super
        technical skill job. I thought because of the opensource culture is very big in software development, the
        passion people have is not only for money or employment, purely technology and simply love making, and puzzle
        solving. I like the passion. I found it similar to art that I am attracted to. Once I start learning, I love
        them. It is like total another universe exists. very different from human world. But whole universe and order in
        here. then the possiblities of making is just unlimited. I love making, so of course I want to become a
        developer to make and find bugs, be in the community also many job opportunities! The below is my paintings.
        Here is my website.
